# My Projects
Welcome to my Github project portfolio! Here you can find a collection of some of the projects I've worked on, ranging from personal projects to collaborations with others. Each project has its own dedicated folder within this repository, containing relevant code, documentation, and resources.

## Table of Contents
1. OpenCV Motion Detector: This application takes video input and converts its pixels from color to greyscale. The image is then passed through a blurring filter in order to remove any noise, in order to create a contour around each object in the image. Any objects that enter the videoframe will be detected. The time at which they enter the frame, as well as their duration are recored in a CSV file.

2. Databases: A very simple framework for creating and querying a database in PostgreSQL and SQLite. Their purose is mainly a demonstration of the fundamentals of database creation and management.

3. Movies & Statistics: Comparing different data cleaning methods. As well as some interesting statistics and insights about some of our favorite movies.

4. Tkinker Library App: A simple widget to keep track of your favorite books and/or personal library in a personal database. With only one click save, update, and delete any entries by Title, Author, Publication Date, ISBN in the database. Also included in the folder is an identical app, but written in a OOP format.

5. Kivy Mobile App: Users can sign up and the app stores their username and password in a database. Tell the app how you're feeling and get an insirational quote to fit your mood.

6. Web Scraping: I originally wrote this Python script for personal use. In order to help my mother search for real estate in her town. It uses Beautiful Soup to parse the relevent HTML from the property website.

7. Website Using Flask (Demo): A basic backend webpage framework for inserting HTML, CSS, and Javascript templates.
